`Accessing Amazon CloudWatch logs for AWS Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html>`_

AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions on your behalf, reporting
metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. To help you troubleshoot failures in a
function, after you set up permissions, Lambda logs all requests handled by
your function and also automatically stores logs generated by your code through
Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

You can insert logging statements into your code to help you validate that your
code is working as expected. Lambda automatically integrates with CloudWatch
Logs and pushes all logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group associated
with a Lambda function, which is named /aws/lambda/<function name>.

You can view logs for Lambda functions using the Lambda console, the CloudWatch
console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the CloudWatch API. This
page describes how to view logs using the Lambda console.


`Using AWS Lambda with AWS X-Ray <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html>`_

You can use AWS X-Ray to visualize the components of your application, identify
performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot requests that resulted in an error.
Your Lambda functions send trace data to X-Ray, and X-Ray processes the data to
generate a service map and searchable trace summaries.

If you've enabled X-Ray tracing in a service that invokes your function, Lambda
sends traces to X-Ray automatically. The upstream service, such as Amazon API
Gateway, or an application hosted on Amazon EC2 that is instrumented with the
X-Ray SDK, samples incoming requests and adds a tracing header that tells
Lambda to send traces or not.
